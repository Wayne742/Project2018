# Introduction.
This project is based on Ronald Fisher's Iris data set. The project contains research regarding the data set and some analysis of the data set using the Python programming language.

What is data analytics and why its important?

## Part 1.
This README is in two distinct sections. The first one is primarily concerning my approach, project plan and discussion on the data set including analysis conducted by others.

### Project Plan.
This is my overall project plan. This has seven stages and as with most projects it is likely that it will change as I work and will not necessarialy be carried out in the order listed. Throughout the project intermittment reviews of progress and tasks outstanding will be carried out.

* __Initial thoughts and Structure__ 
This is the begining for me, I spent some time thinking about how I would aproach the project and I quickly put a structure on the README.

* __Planning__ 
At this stage I identified the key stages for the project and some of the initial task that I wouls carry out as I worked towards completion. Old school pen and paper approach prior to typing up my work.

* __Break out of Tasks__
This is my list of smaller tasks and probaby the bulk of the work.
 * Research background information on the Data Set. And write this up.
 * Outline the Python Programming language and the libaries I have used. 
 * Research analysis conducted by others on the Data Set.
 * Download the Data Set and convert to CSV.
 * Consider ways to analyse the data.
 * Decide on what analysis I will conduct.
 * Start a Python file.
 * Read the data in to the file.
 * Write and test the scripts I want to run.
 * Write up my Approach. 
 * Write Methodology.
 * Consider professional applications for similar types of analysis.
 * References.

* __Start research of data set and analysis by others__

* __Work through each of the above tasks__

* __Write up Introduction and Conclusions__

* __Review and Edit__
  

### Methodology / Approach.
Discussion of the data set, its history. And it's importance in data analytics????
### Ronald Fisher and the Iris Flower Data Set.
Ronald Fisher (1890-1962) was a British Statistician and Geneticist. He is most famous for developing methods of 
multivariate analysis. He had a keen interest in genetics and applied his training in statistics to the Eugenics field including work on Charles Darmins theory on natural selection. [1]

He is credited with fonding the Cambridge University Eugenics Society. In 1936, while Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College London he first introducted the Iris Flower Data Set in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxomony problems".[1]

The data set contains 50 samples from each of the three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor).
The data set describes particular biological characteristics of various types of Iris flower. [2] For each sample the length and width of the Sepals and Petals were measured. 

The data set is widely used across the computer sciences including use in data minng and analytics.

## Part 2.
My work on the data set. What I did with the data, e.g sum, mean, median, etc.
My analysis of the data set is quite rudimentary. I have chosen to apply the following mathmatical operation;

### Sum.
I have summed each column of numbers. For example the sum of the Sepal Lengths is....

### Count.
Counted the total number of lines in hte data set.

### Mean.
The mean is the most commonly used mathimatical measure of average (University of Leicester, 2018).

### Median.
The median refers to the middle value in the dataset, when the values are arranged in order of 
magnitude (University of Leicester, 2018).

### Mode.
The mode is the value that occurs with the greatest frequency in a dataest (University of Leicester, 2018)..

### Find the Highest number in each column.

### Find the lowest number in each column.

## Conclusions.
What are the real world applications for similar types of analysis? 
How could I apply this type of analysis to my work in procurement?
