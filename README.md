### Ronald Fisher and the Iris Flower Data Set.
Ronald Fisher (1890-1962) was a British Statistician and Geneticist. He is most famous for developing methods of 
multivariate analysis. In 1936, while Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College London he first introducted the Iris Flower Data Set in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxomony problems".

The data set contains 50 samples from each of the three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor).
For each sample the length and width of the Sepals and Petals were measured. The data set is widely used across the 
computer sciences including use in data minng and analytics.
