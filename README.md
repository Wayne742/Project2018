# Introduction.
What is data analytics and why its important?

## Part 1.
### Methodology / Approach.
Discussion of the data set, its history. And it's importance in data analytics????
### Ronald Fisher and the Iris Flower Data Set.
Ronald Fisher (1890-1962) was a British Statistician and Geneticist. He is most famous for developing methods of 
multivariate analysis. In 1936, while Galton Professor of Eugenics at University College London he first introducted the Iris Flower Data Set in his paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxomony problems".

The data set contains 50 samples from each of the three species of Iris (Iris Setosa, Iris Virginica and Iris Versicolor).
For each sample the length and width of the Sepals and Petals were measured. The data set is widely used across the 
computer sciences including use in data minng and analytics.

## Part 2.
My work on the data set. What I did with the data, e.g sum, mean, median, etc.
My analysis of the data set is quite rudimentary. I have chosen to apply the following mathmatical operation;

### Sum.
I have summed each column of numbers. For example the sum of the Sepal Lengths is....

### Count.
Counted the total number of lines in hte data set.

### Mean.
The mean is the most commonly used mathimatical measure of average (University of Leicester, 2018).

### Median.
The median refers to the middle value in the dataset, when the values are arranged in order of 
magnitude (University of Leicester, 2018).

### Mode.
The mode is the value that occurs with the greatest frequency in a dataest (University of Leicester, 2018)..

### Find the Highest number in each column.

### Find the lowest number in each column.

## Conclusions.
What are the real world applications for similar types of analysis? 
How could I apply this type of analysis to my work in procurement?
